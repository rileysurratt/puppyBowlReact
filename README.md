# React + Vite
Puppy Bowl React 

# Concept: 
As the web developer for a site like this, your job will be to handle the data about each of our puppy competitors and their owners. To that purpose, you will be interacting with the "Puppy Bowl" API we have built that hosts the data you will need about each puppy, each of its owners, and even the teams they are on. You will make certain requests to our API to get the appropriate data you will need, save that to the state of your React app, and then build various React components to represent that state to your users visually.

# Requirements:
Your site's users should be able to:

- See a list of each player competing in the bowl.
- Click a "See Details" button or something similar on each player that will lead you to another page view   with specific details on that player, such as owner and team name.
- Have a form to CREATE a new player.
- Search for a specific player in a search bar and see a new list with only puppies with names that match the text in the search bar.
- Create a button to DELETE a player (ONLY DELETE PLAYERS YOU YOURSELF CREATE, PLEASE!)
